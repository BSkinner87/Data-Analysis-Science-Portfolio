# Brett Skinner - Data Analysis/Science Portfolio
## About Me
My background is in Applied Mathematics.  After teaching Mathematics for 10 years, I decided that I wanted to change careers to become a data analyst/scientist. My background in math has trained me in pattern recognition and analysis.  I look forward to bringing my analytical skills to the field of data analyst/scientist. 

In working toward this new career goal, I have taken it upon myself to study data science and data analysis in my free time. Furthermore, I have completed the Google Data Analytics course (Coursera) and an online data science program through MIT (Great Learning). The hands on projects in these courses gave me valuable knowledge on different techniques used in data science and familiarity with Tableau, Python, and R.

## Projects
The following are some of the projects that highlight some of my abilities. 
### Analyzing Hate Crimes in America
**Code:** [Hate Crimes in America](https://github.com/BSkinner87/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/HateCrimeStats.md) <br><br>
**Goal:** Analyze the degree to which hate crimes occur against different populations. <br><br>
**Description:** This dataset includes records of individual hate crimes collected by police in the United States.  The data includes A date of the incident, the agency name of where the record came from, the state in which the hate crime occured, population group of the area, the number of offenders, the type of offense, the number of vicitms, the descrimination bias, and victim type (individual or organization).  This project includes data processing, exploratory analysis and data visualization. <br><br>
**Skills:** data processing, data analysis, and data visualization <br><br>
**Libraries:** Tidyverse <br><br>
**Results:** With some estimates on different populations (racial, religious, and identity) from census information, I broke down the amount of hate crimes different groups endure. Anti-black bias is the most significant racial bias, anti-Jewish bias is the most significant religious bias, and anti-gay bias is the most significant LGBTQ bias. I also provided some context for some of the unusual data points. <br><br><br>

### Analysis of Israel-Palestine Conflict (Pre Oct. 7)
**Code:** [Isreal Palestine Conflict (Pre-Oct. 7)](https://github.com/BSkinner87/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Israel_Palestine_Conflict_before_Oct_7_markdown.md) <br><br>

**Goal:** Analyze the respective death counts in the various Israel-Palestine conflicts. <br><br>
**Description:** This dataset includes records of individual deaths in Gaza, West Bank, Israel during different conflicts. The data includes, data of incident, age of individual, citizenship, location of the death (West Bank, Gaza, Israel), gender, place of residence, type of injury, ammunition, who the individual was killed by. This project explores the death counts year to year for each citizenship and provides some context from Amnesty International.  It also explores the mode of death, and the rates at which women/children were killed with respect to total deaths. This project includes data analysis and data visualization. <br><br>
**Skills:** data processing, data analysis, data visualization, exploritory analysis <br><br>
**Libraries:** Tidyverse <br><br>
**Results:** I found Israel forces (IDF) perform most of the killing in the conflicts. It is impossible to determine the number of deaths that are caused by Hamas because the dataset doesn't distinguish between Hamas and Palestinian civilians. With that in mind we see most of the explosive type deaths are caused by Palestinians and most of the deaths on the Palestinian side are caused by the IDF using guns. <br><br><br>

### Dementia Classification
**Code:** [Dementia Classification](https://github.com/BSkinner87/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Dementia.ipynb) <br><br>
**Goal:** Be able to classify patients as Demented or not demented. <br><br>
**Description:** This dataset includes patients with multiple MRIs and a determination on their dementia. The data includes gender, the which visit they had the MRI, Age, Socioeconomic status, Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, Estimated total intracranial volumne, Normalized Whole Brain Volume, and Atlas scaling factor. Some of the features are used in the diagnosis of dementia. I built several models to see if a model would diagnose dementia. This project includes data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, classification, and data science.  <br><br>
**Skills:** Decision trees, Random forests, model tuning, data cleaning, data analysis <br><br>
**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit <br><br>
**Results:** With a random forest I achieved a 95% accuracy in predicting whether or not a patient had dementia. <br><br><br>

### Stroke Prediction
**Code:** [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/BSkinner87/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/StrokePredictionModels.ipynb) <br><br>
**Goal:** Be able to classify whether or not someone had a stroke in an attmept to find features that lead a patient to be more likely to have a stroke. <br><br>
**Description:** This dataset includes patients with various measurements, some with strokes and others not.  The data includes gender, age, hypertension (T/F), prior marriage (T/F), Residential area, Average glucose, bmi, and smoking history. With these limited features, I built several classification models in an attempt to predict whether a patient is at risk of a stroke.  This project includes data cleaning, data analysis, data science, decision tree, random forest, KNN, SVM <br><br>
**Skills:** Decision trees, random forest, KNN, SVM, data cleaning, data analysis, feature importance <br><br>
**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, sci-kit, seaborn, matplotlib <br><br>
**Results:** I was able to achieve an 80% recall rating using a random forest. I used recall since I wanted to be on the safe side when predicting strokes. The most important feature in this dataset was age. <br><br><br>
