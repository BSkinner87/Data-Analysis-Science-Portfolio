# Brett Skinner - Data Analysis/Science Portfolio
## About Me
My background is in Applied Mathematics.  After teaching Mathematics for 10 years, I decided that I wanted to change careers to become a data analyst/scientist. My background in math has trained me in pattern recognition and analysis.  I look forward to bringing my analytical skills to the field of data analyst/scientist. 

In working toward this new career goal, I have taken it upon myself to study data science and data analysis in my free time. Furthermore, I have completed the Google Data Analytics course (Coursera) and an online data science program through MIT (Great Learning). The hands on projects in these courses gave me valuable knowledge on different techniques used in data science and familiarity with Tableau, Python, and R.
